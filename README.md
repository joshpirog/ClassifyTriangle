# ClassifyTriangle

For the test cases I tested all of the cases the triangle should have as well as if the triangleâ€™s sides were properly initialized. I made test for equilateral, isosceles, scalene, and right. I then set up multiple triangle cases in the UnitTest. Once I tested all the properties I could be confident that my code worked as intended.
